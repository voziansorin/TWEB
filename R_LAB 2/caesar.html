        In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the 
        shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest 
        and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution 
        cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some 
        fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift 
        of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is 
        named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

        The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of 
        more complex schemes, such as the Vigen√®re cipher, and still has modern application 
        in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar 
        cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communications 
        security.
